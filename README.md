# PonziLand

Welcome to this repository

PonziLand was created because it was becoming pretty hard to keep track of all these EthPyramid clones, especially when most of them has no front-end.

Here it is, in all its glory. It has pretty much all the features I wanted, and honestly, I am too lazy to continue the development too much.

Feel free to fix some bugs that you may find, create a pull request and if its good I will upload it to the main site. Feel free to add your name, list of features and a donate link at the bottom of the page.

#### Some features requested by the community:

1. Better design

2. Display ratio of user's tokens / token supply - but the table is pretty thick already, maybe move all the action buttons (buy, sell, withdraw, reinvest, get out) into a single drop-down-column?

3. New web-chat, the current one is crap - something like the current one, so sending messages is and doesn't refresh the page
